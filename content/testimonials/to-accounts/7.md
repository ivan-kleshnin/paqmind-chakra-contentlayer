After some learning on javascript.info decided to continue self-education with mentor. The choice
fell on Ivan as I was bought over by his approach to mentoring. He builts a learning program tailoring
it to your goals and talents. He also has an ability to share basic and advanced knowledge equally well.

During the month of training I managed to learn React fundamentals and to create my first realistic
application. I've also tried out my skills at Backend, building a simple CRUD Koa app. I feel like
I'm significantly raised my programming and JavaScript competence after a few interview trainings
(or were they lectures? ;). That last part, I think, was the most useful for me.

Ivan is very attentive to details, makes great code reviews (I have experience to compare). In
any topic of interest, he can immerse you to the depth you're still able to understand but couldn't
get there on your own. I will surely continue my learning with him.
