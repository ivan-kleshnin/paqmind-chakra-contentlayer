I subscribed with very basic JavaScript knowledge and no idea how to convert it to something
practical. I didn't expect that hard topics of CSS and JS will be explained to me in so clear
manner. Note, that I never programmed before and, while I'm still far from being a confident engineer,
the progress is obvious. Here you'll get an individual approach and a lot of interesting exercises.
Recommended to everyone planning to advance in web development or even reach a new level :)
